    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "### The rationale for choosing models for this problem is the \"Choosing the right estimator sheet\" in scikit-learn documentation. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Ensemble Methods (Bagging, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)\n",
    "\n",
    "• Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble Methods are particularly good at predictive tasks, and due to their general purpose nature can be applied to many different situations. Real-world example of their application is making product recommendations to users, for creating trade startegy signals for Algorithmic-Trading, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "• What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "The major strength of Ensemble Methods is that it is very difficult for the model to overfit, because the model only improves as you increase the complexity of the model (e.g. Bagging; by building more and more independent estimators, the resulting average of the estimators will only improve).\n",
    "\n",
    "• What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "The major weaknesses to do with Ensemble Methods are related to increased storage and computation. Since Ensemble Methods require multiple classifiers, there is a need for more storage for the classifiers which can be costly. In a simliar vein, all of the classifiers need to be processed, rather than just one, which means that the run time of the algorithm is higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "• What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the task is to construct a model to perform binary classification of whether an individual makes over $50k or not, Ensemble Methods should generate valuable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "• Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "One real-world application of Decision Trees is in the 'Automated Identification of Cosmic-Ray Hits in Hubble Space Telescope Images' (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1995PASP..107..279S). The goal of the model is to predict cosmic-ray hits, and has successfully done so with 95% accuracy. Decision Trees were well suited to the problem because of the need for fast classification time.\n",
    "\n",
    "• What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "The major strengths of Decision Tree models are that they are easy to use, run quickly, able to handle both categorical & numerical data, and graphically allow you to interpret the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "• What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "The major weakness of Decision Trees is that it is highly prone to overfitting. One solution to this is to track its performance and prune the branches so that not too many features are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "• What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Decision Tree model is a good candidate for this problem as Decision Tree models are particularly adept at binary classification, however it may run into problems due to the number of features (especially all the iterations of native-country) so care will have to be taken with regards to feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "\n",
    "• Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "One real-world application of Support Vector Machines is in modelling the prediction for common diseases. Listing down few other possible uses for SVM:\n",
    "1. Face detection – SVMs classify parts of the image as a face and non-face and create a square boundary around the face.\n",
    "2. Text and hypertext categorization – SVMs allow Text and hypertext categorization for both inductive and transductive models. They use training data to classify documents into different categories. It categorizes on the basis of the score generated and then compares with the threshold value.\n",
    "3. Classification of images – Use of SVMs provides better search accuracy for image classification. It provides better accuracy in comparison to the traditional query-based searching techniques.\n",
    "4. Bioinformatics – It includes protein classification and cancer classification. We use SVM for identifying the classification of genes, patients on the basis of genes and other biological problems.\n",
    "5. Protein fold and remote homology detection – Apply SVM algorithms for protein remote homology detection.\n",
    "6. Handwriting recognition – We use SVMs to recognize handwritten characters used widely.\n",
    "7. Generalized predictive control(GPC) – Use SVM based GPC to control chaotic dynamics with useful parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "• What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "SVMs work particularly well in complicated domains where there's a clear margin of separation.\n",
    "\n",
    "• What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "SVMs don't work well in large datasets because of the growing amount of time it takes to classify the data. They also don't work well when there's lots of noise, as SVMs can overfit to noise in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "• What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "SVMs are strongly capable of classifying non-linear data which may prove useful in this dataset, but the main reason I chose the model was because I am curious to find out if this dataset is too large and has too many features for an SVM to perform successfully. In as valuable as it is to find the right models, I think it is equally valuable to prove to yourself that certain models may not be the best choice."

    "Of the three models chosen, the best performing model on the task of identifying individudals who make more than $50,000 was the AdaBoost Classifier. It had a higher Accuracy Score and F-score on the Testing Set for each training set size than either the Decision Trees Classifier or the Support Vector Classifier. One flaw with the Decision Tree Classifier is that it appears to have overfitted on the training data, as it performed much better on the testing subset taken out from the training set using train_test_split than it did on the testing set. One flaw with the Support Vector Classifier was the amount of time it took to train the classifier and then to make predictions, making it more challenging to iterate on and improve quickly. It was also not able to produce an F-score on neither the training subset nor the testing subset - likely because it was unable to predict a positive class at all, which would make F1 equal to 0/0. When the SVM has only seen a small portion of the training data, it can suffer from bias and will tend to predict only one of the classes for every data point. This causes an error in calculating the F-beta score. For these reasons, and for the reason that the AdaBoost Classifier performs particularly well on questions of binary classification, it would appear to be the best model to choose for CharityML."

    "The model I have chosen to use is the AdaBoost Classifier, which is an Ensemble Method technique. In simple terms, the AdaBoost Classifier is just a combination of a bunch of different learning algorithms that are slightly better at making predictions than flipping a coin. Based on how good they are at classifying the data, they have greater influence over the resulting model. One clever part of this technique is that its predictions are improved by simple models that classify the data in wholly different ways; the diversity in the classification of each model, the stronger the resulting weighted sum of the models is. A good way to think about the technique is to think about adding the models sequentially, and in a subsequent model placing less emphasis on points that had been correctly categorised previously and more emphasis on the points that were incorrectly categorised previously.\n",

    "A very crude analogy one could make is mixing different types of alcohol on a night out. Let's pretend that getting drunk is like classifying data. If you drink solely beer, you will be able to get drunk, but not nearly as drunk as you would as if you were to also drink wine and tequila because of the different components of the alcohol (e.g. grain vs fruit vs cactus). Each alcohol has a different physiological effect on your body, and different sources interact in a way that heightens its effect. In this way, mixing different models together with differing weights can help improve classification. Interestingly, the more models included, the better the classification, in a similar fashion to the more different types of alcohol you drink, the drunker you become; this is a unique and somewhat counterintuitive property of boosting methods because one would assume adding more models would lead to overfitting, but it does not occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another real life example could be that AdaBoost, in image recognition, uses a number of training sample images (such as faces) to pick a number of good 'features'/'classifiers'. For face recognition a classifiers is typically just a rectangle of pixels that has a certain average color value and a relative size. AdaBoost will look at a number of classifiers and find out which one is the best predictor of a face based on the sample images. After it has chosen the best classifier it will continue to find another and another until some threshold is reached and those classifiers combined together will provide the end result.\n",

    "It was pretty close. I did not predict capital-loss being as strong a feature as capital-gain, and my #1 choice of Occupation didn't make the top 5, though all the rest made it (albeit in a different order). I think it makes sense that age, capital gain/loss, hours-per-week, and education-num would have a strong effect as I outlined above, though I would have expected education-num to have had a bigger effect than age. I do also have a hunch that the features importances function has a preference for numerical rather than categorical data."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

If the dataset was sufficiently large or that the chosen model took a particularly long time to train (e.g. an Support Vector Classifier) that training time was an important factor to consider, I think it would be better to use the final model trained on reduced data, if there is a restriction on time, though it would not be ideal."
